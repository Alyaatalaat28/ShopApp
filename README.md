# shopEase

This Flutter project uses Rest APIs, bloc, dio package, and shared preferences to create a user-friendly app. It includes onboarding screens to introduce users to the app and its features. The app communicates with a server to fetch and display data and uses shared preferences to store user data locally on the device.
